# DSTN-DDPG-for-User-Click-Probability-Prediction
Enhancing User Click Probability Prediction Using Auxiliary Ads: An Ensemble and Reinforcement Learning Approach

This repository contains the codes needed for predicting user click probability using DSTN integrated ensemble and reinforcement learning.
To run the code for one trial and to get the full metric results and graphs, please use the the file dstn_ddpg.py file.
For the t-test of 10 trials, please access the file trials.py.

The datasets are located in the dataset file. Due to capacity constraints, only a preview of the dataset was uploaded.
